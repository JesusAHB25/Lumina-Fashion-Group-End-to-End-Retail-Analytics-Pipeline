# Lumina Fashion Group: End-to-End Retail Analytics Pipeline

## 📊 Project Overview
This project transforms fragmented retail data into a strategic analytical engine. By integrating sales, customer, product, and store data, I identified key inefficiencies in discount strategies and seasonal inventory management, providing actionable recommendations to optimize net revenue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy
* **Database Logic:** SQL (PostgreSQL compatible)
* **Documentation:** Notion (Executive Reporting)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Pipeline
The project is divided into four distinct phases:

1.  **Extraction & Integration:** Migration of flat CSV files into a Relational Data Model (Star Schema) using SQLAlchemy and SQL JOINs.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Implementation of a cleaning pipeline to handle missing values (COALESCE logic), standardize temporal data, and ensure financial integrity.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Multidimensional analysis focusing on seasonal trends, regional performance, and discount elasticity.
4.  **Strategic Recommendations:** Business-oriented insights aimed at margin optimization and inventory efficiency.

## 📈 Key Insights
* **Discount Inelasticity:** Analysis proved that high discounts (20%+) do not drive higher quantity per transaction, suggesting a pivot to volume-based bundles.
* **Hero Products:** Identified "White" color staples in Accessories and Dresses as the primary revenue drivers across all regions.
* **Seasonality Gap:** Detected a misalignment between product season attributes and actual sales months, leading to a recommendation for synchronized clearance windows.
